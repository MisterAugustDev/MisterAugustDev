# Hello, everyone!  
**My name is Augusto Luiz Melaré.**

I have been studying to be a back-end .NET developer since 2024.
I used to work as English teacher, but one day I decided to change career. It all started becuse I wanted to do something related to videogames.
So I decided to try coding. I started by learning Pyhton just to have a feeling of what is working with code.
Shortly after I came to know the .NET platform, which has a very popular videogames engine, and took a C# learning path.
And here I am. I study Computer Science at Fatec São Paulo and reserve my Saturdays to improve my C# and back-end skills.
I was born and currently live in the state of São Paulo, Brazil.

**My Languages:**

| Language            | Level  |
| :------------------:|:------:|
| Portuguese (Brazil) | Native |
| English             | C1     |
| Spanish             | B1     |
| German              | A2     |

**My current goals:**

+ Learn more C# and then .NET frameworks;
+ Study SQL;
+ Study Azure;
+ Finish Unity's free 2D game developer course;
+ Improve my Spanish and German.


**Now, some other fun facts about me:**
+ I am a goth boy and love make-up and tattoos;
+ Sometimes I make my own clothes;
+ I had plenty of good time playing Minecraft back then; today I often play Just Dance.
