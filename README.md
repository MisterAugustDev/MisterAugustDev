Hello, everyone. My name is Augusto Luiz Melare, also known as Mister August. I am studying to be game and fullstack developer since 2024.
I was an English teacher until 2023. When I decided to change my career, I was certain I wanted to do something related to videogame creation. So I decided to study coding.
I tried Python fist just to feel what it is to work with programming languages. Afterwards, I chose Unity as my first game engine and started studying C#.
As I study this language, I not only think about videogames I want to develope, but also I though of some apps.
I intend to learn a whole lot of Unity development this year and then study Construct 3.
One of my goals in this career is to have my own indie games company. I already have listed some ideas for 2D games.
Besides becoming a game and fullstack developer, I also want to learn pixel art. That will help me a lot when I create my first games all by myself before having a crew.
I speak English fluently, Spanish almost fluently, Brasilian Portuguese as native speaker and a little bit of German. I do hope I get a B2 level in German in 2026.

Now, some other fun facts about me:
1 - I am a goth boy and love make-up and tattoos;
2 - Sometimes I make my own clothes;
3 - I had plenty of good time playing Minecraft back then; today I often play Just Dance.

Thanks for reading.
Your dearest weirdo Mister August.
